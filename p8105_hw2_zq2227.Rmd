## Problem 3 
### Baseline data
```{r}
baseline_data = 
  read_csv("./MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1)|>
  janitor::clean_names()|> # clean column 
  mutate(age_at_onset=replace(age_at_onset, age_at_onset == ".", NA_character_))|>
  filter(current_age < age_at_onset|is.na(age_at_onset))|>#remove any participants who has MCI at baseline
  mutate(age_at_onset,age_at_onset=as.numeric(age_at_onset))|>
  mutate(sex,sex=ifelse(sex==1,"Male","Female"))|> # change the sex index from "1,0" to character
  mutate(apoe4,apoe4=ifelse(apoe4==1,"Carrier","Noncarrier")) # change the apoe4  from "1,0" to character "carrier, noncarrier.
```
```{r}
baseline_data
```

```{r}

nrow(baseline_data)# number of participants were recruited in  baseline data 
```
479 participants were recruited in baseline data 
```{r}
mcidevelop=filter(baseline_data, !is.na(age_at_onset))
nrow(mcidevelop) # number of participants develop MCI
```
93 participants develop MCI in basline data

```{r}
mean(pull(baseline_data,current_age)) #average baseline age in cleaned baseline data. 
```
The average baseline age in cleaned baseline data is 65,03.
```{r}
womennumber=filter(baseline_data,sex=="Female")
nrow(womennumber)# number of total women number in post-processed baseline data. 
womencarrier=filter(baseline_data,sex=="Female" & apoe4=="Carrier")
nrow(womencarrier)# number of women is APOE4 carrier#
ratio=nrow(womencarrier)/nrow(womennumber)
ratio # proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers: number of women carrier/  total women number in post-processed baseline data. 
```
The proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers :0.3

### Biomarker data
```{r}
amyloid_data=
  read_csv("./mci_amyloid.csv", skip=1)|>#import
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  rename(id=study_id)|> # change variables names same as baseline data
  pivot_longer(
    baseline:time_8,
    names_to = "time", 
    values_to = "ratio")# tidy the dataset of longitudinally observed biomarker values
```
```{r}
amyloid_data
```

### merge baseline and amyloid
```{r}
onlyinbaseline= anti_join(baseline_data,amyloid_data,by="id")
onlyinbaseline
```
There are 8 participants ID appear in only the baseline. 
```{r}
onlyinamyloid=anti_join(amyloid_data,baseline_data,by="id")
onlyinamyloid
nrow(onlyinamyloid)/5
```
There are 16 participants ID appear in only the amyloid datasets.

### Combine the demographic and biomarker datasets 
```{r}
admerge=
  inner_join(baseline_data,amyloid_data, by="id")|>#  keep the participants that appear in both  basline and amyloid datasets.
  mutate(sex,sex=as.factor(sex))|># change sex to factor 
  mutate(apoe4,apoe4=as.factor(apoe4))|># change APOE4 to factor 
  mutate(time,time=as.factor(time))|>
  mutate(ratio,ratio=as.numeric(ratio)) #change the variables: Î²42/40 ratio from chr to num so that esier to observation.
```
```{r}
admerge
write_csv(admerge,"./ADdieasedata.csv") #Exporting data as cvs. name is ADdieasemergedata

```

### Observation and discussion
```{r}
summary(admerge)
```
#### Description: Thee averge age of the merge data is 65.05 and there are 1025 female and 1330 male in the data. The average education years is 16.38 yesrs. In the datasets, there are 710 participants are apoe4 carrier. In the MCI patients, the averge age at the onset of MCI is  70.51 years old. The median valuse of the Î²42/40 ratio is 0.10967.
```{r}
apoe4compareplot=ggplot(admerge, aes(x = time, y = ratio)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ apoe4, ncol = 2) +
  labs(title = "Î²42/40 ratio between APOE4Carrier and APOE4Non-carrier", x = "Time", y = "Î²
 42/40 Ratio ")
apoe4compareplot
```
```{r}
ggsave("apoe4 ratio comparison.png",plot=apoe4compareplot)
```
* According  to the plot,in the baseline group, the APOE4carrier has a lower Î²42/40 ratio than APOE4 non carrier.Since the APOE4 is significantly associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimerâs disease and the  Î² 42/40 ratio linked to  clinical symptoms of Alzheimerâs disease.The  APOE4 carrier has a higher risk of developing Alzheimerâs disease accompanied by a lower Î² 42/40 ratio over time.
A low Î² 42/40 also indicate the risk of Alzheimerâs disease.As  participants age, their  Î² 42/40 ratio levels gradually decline.
